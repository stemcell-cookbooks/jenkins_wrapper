Recipes that are wrapped into `jenkins_wrapper::default`
---
#### jenkins::master

- Install Jenkins from the official jenkins-ci.org packages

#### jenkins::java

- This very simple recipe installs OpenJDK 7 on the target system. If you need a more complex Java setup, you should use the community cookbook or write your own.

- Installs nginx proxy

#### jenkins_wrapper::plugins

- WIP

Roadmap
---
- script configurations for jenkins plugins (MUST)
- AWS compatibility (COULD)
- RHEL compatibility (COULD)

Unit testing coverage is still low; we use foodcritic and knife tests.
